# Churn Prediction System

## Overview
This project involves developing a Churn Prediction System to identify customers likely to stop using a service, crucial for industries like telecom, SaaS, and banking where customer retention is key. The system uses real customer data to train and evaluate a machine learning model, with findings presented in an analytics dashboard.

## Features
- **Churn Probability by Tenure**: Visualizes the relationship between customer tenure and churn probability.
- **Churn Probability by Monthly Charges Bin**: Displays churn distribution across monthly charge bins using a pie chart.
- **Churn Distribution by Probability**: Shows the distribution of churn probabilities.
- **Trend of Churn Probability Over Tenure**: Illustrates how churn probability changes with tenure.
- **Churn Probability vs. Monthly Charges**: Highlights the correlation between monthly charges and churn probability.

## Usage
1. Explore the visualizations to understand churn drivers.
2. Analyze the probability trends and distributions to identify at-risk customers.
3. Use insights to inform retention strategies.

## Data Source
The data is sourced from a customer dataset (e.g., Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle), processed to train the predictive model.
